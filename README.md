## Hey I'm Kiyomi ðŸ’¿

This is my first time using github for personal projects, so here's my personal info.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java, thanks to college, but I recently got into a small CISCO course, and I've been trying to learn the syntax from other programming languages.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m want to be able to do my own little projects so that i can get into the big world of programming soon and get into bigger projects.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help for reviewing all data structures I didn't understand completely in my 2nd semester, but I've been reviewing it alone on spring break too.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my hobbies and special interests, everyone says that for a reason, I love talking to be honest.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: My institutional mail (on the side), or my personal mail (kiyomi.martinez.clk@gmail.com)
- âš¡ Fun fact: This was a task for my course, but I've learned so much from it about git, so I'm enjoying doing the readme.
